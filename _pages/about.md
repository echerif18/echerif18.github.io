About Me
======
I am Eya Cherif, a Ph.D. researcher at Leipzig University and the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (ScaDS.AI), where I am part of the Remote Sensing in Geo- and Ecosystem Research team.

My research lies at the intersection of deep learning and environmental science, with a strong focus on biodiversity monitoring. I am jointly supervised by Prof. Hannes Feilhauer and Prof. Teja Kattenborn.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from a double-degree program with University of Passau (2021), and a background as a Telecommunication Engineer from Sup’Com. My master’s thesis explored deep learning methods for land cover classification using multispectral and SAR data — a project that sparked my passion for applying advanced technologies to environmental challenges.

As a Ph.D. candidate, I am now developing novel deep learning approaches for estimating vegetation properties using hyperspectral remote sensing data.

During my Ph.D. journey, I also had the opportunity to conduct a research stay at Mila, under the supervision of Prof. David Rolnick and Dr. Arthur Ouaknine, where I contributed to a forest monitoring project.

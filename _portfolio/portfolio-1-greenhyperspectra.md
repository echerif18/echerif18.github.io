Created GreenHyperSpectra, a large-scale multi-source hyperspectral pretraining dataset designed to enable label-efficient machine learning for global vegetation trait prediction. Developed self-supervised and semi-supervised learning methods that overcome critical challenges of label scarcity and domain shifts across sensors, ecosystems, and geographical regions.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented self-supervised learning framework (MAE) using PyTorch for robust spectral representations
- Compiled multi-source dataset spanning diverse sensors, ecosystems, and geographical regions for pretraining foundation models
- Developed semi-supervised approaches leveraging both labeled and unlabeled samples to improve label efficiency

**Technologies:** PyTorch, Weights & Biases, Google Earth Engine, QGIS, Python, HPC Systems

**Impact:**
- **Publication:** Presented and accepted at NeurIPS 2025
- **Dataset Release:** Publicly available benchmark for vegetation trait prediction research

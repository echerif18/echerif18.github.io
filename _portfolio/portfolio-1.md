title: "GreenHyperSpectra: Self-Supervised Learning for Global Vegetation Monitoring"
excerpt: "Created GreenHyperSpectra, a large-scale multi-source hyperspectral pretraining dataset designed to enable label-efficient machine learning for global vegetation trait prediction. Developed self-supervised and semi-supervised learning methods that overcome critical challenges of label scarcity and domain shifts across sensors, ecosystems, and geographical regions. <br/>"

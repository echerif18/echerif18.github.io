# ♻️ Reuse — AI Chatbot for Smart Recycling

## 📌 Overview
**Reuse** is an AI-powered chatbot that helps users transform everyday waste into reusable objects.  
It combines image recognition, machine learning, and conversational AI to provide personalized reuse ideas and sustainability guidance.

The project was developed for the **Atos IT Challenge 2019**, where the team reached the finalist stage.

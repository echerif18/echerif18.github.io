I am Eya Cherif, a Ph.D. student at Leipzig University and the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (ScaDS.AI), with a joint appointment in the Remote Sensing in Geo- and Ecosystem Research team. 

Under the joint supervision of Prof. Hannes Feilhauer and Prof. Teja Kattenborn, my current research is centered around the application of deep learning techniques in environmental science, with a specific focus on biodiversity monitoring using hyperspectral data. 

I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science through a double-degree program with University of Passau in 2021, building upon a foundation as a Telecommunication Engineer from Sup'Com. During my master's thesis, I delved into the realm of deep learning techniques using multispectral and SAR data for land cover classification, which ignited my passion for leveraging advanced technologies in environmental research. Now, as a Ph.D. candidate, I am excited to continue this journey by investigating novel deep learning approaches for vegetation properties estimation using hyperspectral data.

I am currently a Visiting Research Intern at Mila, supervised by Prof. David Rolnick and Dr. Arthur Ouaknine, where I am further exploring the intersection of deep learning for forest monitoring.

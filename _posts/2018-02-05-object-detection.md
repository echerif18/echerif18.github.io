In this blog post I will review the state-of-the art of object detection models. I will provide details about the evolution of the architectures of the most accurate object detection models from 2012 up to today. One of my analysis criteria will be on their speed at inference allowing real-time analysis. Note that researchers test their algorithms using different datasets (PASCAL VOC, COCO, ImageNet) which are different between the years. Thus the cited accuracies cannot be directly compared per se.

In this blog post, architecture of a few previous state-of-the-art models on image semantic segmentation challenges are detailed. Note that researchers test their algorithms using different datasets (PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, COCO, Cityscapes) which are different between the years and use different metrics of evaluation. Thus the cited performances cannot be directly compared per se.
